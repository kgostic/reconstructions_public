## Function to calculate probs of first exposure in year x, given birth in year y
## INPUTS
##    - year in which an individual was born (birth.year)
##    - year in which the individual became infected with bird flu (incidence year)
## OUTPUTS
##    - vector of 13 probabilities, the first representing the probability of first flu infection in the first year of life (age 0), the second representing the probability of first flu infection in the second year of life (age 1), and so on up to the 13th year of life (age 12)
get.e_ij = function(birth.year, incidence.year){
  ################# Inputs ---------------
  #Load saved data on intensity of influenza circulation in specific years of first infection
  intensities = read.csv('Intensitymatser.csv', col.names = c('Year', 'Intensity')); rownames(intensities) = 1911:2017
  p.est = .28 # Set the annual probability of first infection, estimated from serological data (see two papers by Sauerbrei et al., and methods from Gostic et al., Science 2016)
  # Weighted attack rate = annual prob infection weighted by circulation intensity
  weighted.attack.rate = p.est*(intensities$Intensity); names(weighted.attack.rate) = 1911:2017
  
  ################# Calculations ---------------
  jjs = birth.year:min(birth.year+12, incidence.year) #Possible years of first infection (ages 0-12)
  nn = length(jjs) # How many possible years of infection?
  ajs = weighted.attack.rate[as.character(jjs)] #Get weighted attack rates corresponding to possible years of first infection
  ## Create matrices of 0s and 1s, which will be used below to vectorize and speed calculations
  ii = not_ii = matrix(0, nn, nn) #create two square matrices of dim nn
  diag(ii) = 1   #Fill in diagonal of one with 1s. Use this below as a binar indicator that marks the year of first infection. 1s will be multiplied by aj, the attack rate in year of first infection j
  not_ii[lower.tri(not_ii)] = 1  #Fill in sub-diagonal for all the years since birth in which the individual escaped infection. 1s will be multiplied by 1-ak, for all years in which a child remained naive.
  # Below, multiplying across rows of this matrix will calculate overall probability of first infection at different ages, given by prod{j = birth year, j = 1-j_first_infection}(1-aj)*a_yr_first_infection
  
  #Create a matrix that takes (1-aj) for all non-infection years and aj for all infection years
  prod.mat = ajs*ii+matrix(rep(1-ajs, nn), nn, nn, byrow = T)*not_ii
  ## Now prod.mat has probabilities of infection in a given year on the diagonal and probabilities of no infection in the sub-diagonal triangle.
  #Fill in upper triangle with 1s to make multiplication possible
  prod.mat[upper.tri(prod.mat)] = 1
  
  #Take product across rows
  e_ij = apply(prod.mat, 1, prod)
  e_ij # Output probability of first infection in year j given birth in year i.
